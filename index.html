        <p>Admiral Sir Hugh Tweedie was born in Woolwich in 1877. He led an extraordinary life in the Royal Navy and was involved in many of the most significant events of the early 20th century including the Mexican Civil War, the First World War, the Turkish War of Independence and the Chinese Civil War. In his memoirs, <em>The Story of a Naval Life</em>, he recounts his life in the Royal Navy, rising from a cadet at the naval training college <em>Britannia</em> to commanding the North Fleet Destroyers during World War I. He was eventually made Commander-in-Chief of Africa Station, followed by Commander-in-Chief, The Nore.</p>

<p>Admiral Sir Hugh Tweedie published his autobiography <em>The Story of a Naval Life</em> in 1939. It has been out of print for many years and is now available for download in ebook format.</p>
