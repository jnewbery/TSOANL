#CHAPTER XIII

####GRAND FLEET DESTROYERS

As soon as my relief arrived I left Venice, bound for Scapa Flow, and late one evening I was deposited by the drifter from Scrabster alongside the *Champion*, learning for the first time that I was not only captain of the *Champion* but also Captain D. Thirteenth Flotilla, consisting of thirty-two destroyers and two leaders. Fairie, whom I was relieving, was in a hurry to get off and join some other ship and in half an hour was gone. My first visit to the *Queen Elizabeth* did not help much, but I learnt I was attached to the battlecruisers and should report on board the *Lion*. Here I found Admiral Pakenham, my one-time captain in the *Albion*. He really seemed pleased to see me, told me I had a big job ahead, we were due for sea at daylight, and then gave me some dinner for which I was profoundly grateful. After dinner Heaton Ellis, then chief of staff to the battle-cruisers, put me wise to a great deal that was going on. Back to the ship about nine and a long night reading up orders, battle instructions, etc., for I had lost touch, as one did in the War with anything beyond the immediate surroundings which formed a little world of its own, all absorbing.

I had gathered that we normally based at Rosyth with the battle-cruisers, that about half the flotilla was in company, the remainder on patrol, convoy duty, or various odd jobs. Morning came and with it orders for the Fleet proceeding to sea were cancelled. I was glad to be able to take my party out independently for a few hours, just to see how much I had forgotten and how much things had changed; it soon came back, after a couple of hours in the Pentland Firth I returned to harbour feeling much more confident than I did the night before. A day or so later we returned to Rosyth, the battle-cruisers being berthed below the bridge, we above the bridge in a long line which stretched nearly to Boness. To see a commanding officer whose ship happened to be towards the other end of the line might take two hours, if the tide was adverse; to get a signal passed up and down was inefficient as it would have, taking an extreme case, to be repeated sixty times.

My first impression was that, considering we had now been at war two years, the base conditions were appalling and until they were put right nothing much could be done. Oiling the flotilla alone was a long, inefficient, and tedious process. Sometimes one, sometimes two tankers, two by two the destroyers had to go alongside officers and men already tired; the last two to oil might be kept standing by for twenty-four hours, finding when they had finished it was time to go to sea again.

Port Edgar, built as a destroyer base, was nearly completed; its design had not taken into account the increase in size of destroyers or the water they drew. I had to request dredgers to be sent to get sixteen feet of water alongside all the penns. The first reply from the department concerned was that Port Edgar must only be used by the smaller destroyers of the Thirteenth Flotilla the others being berthed as before. I had to reply: “There are now no smaller destroyers in the flotilla; V's and W’s are arriving almost daily and the remaining R's draw as much water.” It was considered that deeper dredging would bring the piles down; the risk had to be taken or the whole project was useless. I got my way, the dredgers were sent and it was not long before the whole of the Thirteenth Flotilla could get into the penns simultaneously, oiling, drawing ammunition, new torpedoes, stores of all kinds, without their transport by boat.

It would seem that in a modern war an admiral must have base facilities to deal with at least thirty destroyers at a time. Fifty would be safer and every necessary requirement must be on the spot. Destroyers are hard worked and it is essential that what harbour time can be given them should not be used steaming about here for oil, there for ammunition, somewhere else for victualling stores, etc. The relief to the engine-room alone, in being able to shut off steam as soon as the ship is secured, is worth a heavy expenditure.

One of the first things introduced was a central store system now familiar throughout the service. Under one roof all stores necessary for a flotilla could be drawn and accounted for. I always had in mind that Port Edgar should be developed to be able to cater for the whole of the Grand Fleet flotillas and this was done before the end of the War.

But in the meantime I fell foul of the Admiral Superintendent at Rosyth. Port Edgar was part and parcel of the dockyard and they kept dockyard hours, which did not fit in with the very uncertain hours we kept. Matters came to a head when, having arrived back after dockyard hours, we found every one had retired to Edinburgh where they mostly lived. The C-in-C. had come in with the main fleet and one of his first questions, as always, was: “How soon can you be ready for sea?” My reply was not at all satisfactory. The next day I had to explain the situation and give it as my opinion that we could never get full value out of Port Edgar unless it came directly under my orders exactly like a depot ship. The waste of perhaps twelve hours, because the dockyard was closed, was intolerable in wartime. Sir David Beatty agreed. I do not know what passed when the Admiral Superintendent was sent for, but I received a signal from him that I was to attend a dockyard conference tomorrow morning.

He was very angry, he must have thought, I suppose, that I had been criticizing the dockyard in some way. I hadn't, but had merely pointed out that the organization as it stood was not suitable for our purpose. None of his remarks were complimentary, the gist of them being that I was a silly young captain who thought he could run things better than he could. And turning to his various heads of departments, he said: “Gentlemen, all your people will be out of Port Edgar by nine-thirty to-morrow morning.” There being a lull in the storm I meekly remarked that it seemed hardly fair to give me less than twenty-four hours to take over. He, the admiral, knew I had no resources on the spot and would have to get all the ratings up from the depots in the south. “Ah! I thought so. I thought when it came to the point you would find some difficulty.” Of course there were difficulties, but it was no good saying so now, so I agreed it should be nine-thirty and so Port Edgar came into being as a naval establishment.

The admiral's ire soon died down and we worked in the greatest harmony for the rest of the War. At the moment I had a busy twelve hours. We had to find riggers, fitters, turners, butchers, bakers, specially trained artificers for the gyro-room, white head shed, the oil-pumping plant had to be kept going, and above all the electric light plant and dynamo-room. This plant supplied the light for the hospital and other important buildings besides Port Edgar itself. The wires were kept busy, the depots played up and most of the men I wanted were in the train that afternoon and in Edinburgh the next morning. My good friend, Quex Sinclair, had now taken on as chief of the staff, batti-cruisers, and I could always rely on him to find a way out if there was a hitch.

My senior half-flotilla leader had, it so happened, just been promoted and I prevailed on him, with the C-in-C 's approval, to let me instal him as first captain of Port Edgar. Captain Cherry went into residence in a little tin hut previously occupied by the Pier Master and in the course of a very short time transformed it into what the house agents would call a highly desirable residence.

That was the captain installed, but where should the men live? The *Woolwich*, the flotilla depot ship, happened to be the smallest depot ship existing, looking after the largest flotilla; she could not possibly accommodate any more. In fact, the housing of her present ship's company was acute, they were mainly berthed in a merchant ship called the *Princess Louise*. This ship was moored a mile or more from the *Woolwich* and the time lost in transporting highly skilled ratings backwards and forwards twice a day was, in the aggregate, enormous. The *Princess Louise* also accommodated the sick and men under punishment. As the total number in the command was some four thousand there were bound to be some both sick and, shall we say, indiscreet among them. The discipline was not good and I made up my mind she must go, principally because we must get the men nearer their work and that could not be done with a ship of this size and tonnage. There was a shortage of merchant shipping and it did not take long to convince every one that here was a fine ship ready for sea and we were no longer justified in retaining her merely for purposes of accommodation. The *Colombine* hulk was moored close to the *Woolwich*; she was used, or a bit of her was used to berth Admiralty pilots; these latter were retained for piloting and berthing oil tankers, store ships, etc., of which there was a constant stream going in and out.

I made my second enemy, temporarily I hope, by going on board the *Colombine* and informing the King's Harbour Master that I was going to ask the C-in-C. if I could have the *Colombine* to accommodate three hundred naval ratings and what should he have to say about it. He was not happy about the idea, there was he said no other suitable place for the pilots. I had to find this, and as luck would have it found a house right on the point by the old Queen's Ferry harbour. It had a fine view down the firth and with room for the tugs to lay right under the windows. The house had been used as a boarding-house, but trade was bad, and in a few minutes it had been secured for the Admiralty pilots. Back to the *Colombine* to explain how much more conveniently the pilotage work could be done from the house in question and then to the admiral to secure the *Colombine*.

The C-in-C. agreed the *Princess Louise* was to go, and the dockyard was to get out estimates for the necessary alterations in the *Colombine*. The estimate was much too big and the time required out of the question. My chief carpenter sketched out what was necessary: water, light, sanitary details, mess decks, petty officers' messes, sick bay, and so on; it all had to be done in ten days. Back again to the *Lion* to borrow from the chief of staff as many shipwrights, carpenters, electricians and plumbers as he could possibly spare from the battle-cruisers. I was now I suppose public enemy No. 1 to all the commanders in all the battle-cruisers. But to the chief carpenter and all those ratings who worked like trojans night and day it is only now possible to express my thanks and appreciation. The depot ship's company were in the *Colombine* within ten days and the *Princess Louise* sailed.

Work at this time was rather strenuous. I had no staff but a very able secretary, Beall, and Clegg, the signal officer Beall was then only an assistant paymaster and how he and his writers got through the work I was constantly adding to I never knew. While the problem of the base was being sorted out, there were others of even more importance, those that directly affected the fighting efficiency. I had been brought up in the belief, which I rigidly adhere to, that the fighting unit of destroyers is the division and that everything must give way to keeping this division together under one commander. In the months shortly before the war this divisional work had, under Brand, Tyrwhitt in the Second Flotilla, and Sir Robert Arbuthnot in the First, been brought to a high state of efficiency.

It seemed it had all gone or nearly gone; I found commanding officers who did not know who their divisional leader was, or even what division they belonged to, and more who confessed to never having met their Captain D. personally. Every time the fleet put to sea it was necessary to reorganize. There were many reasons for this state of affairs: the necessity for odd convoys, attendance on big ships doing gunnery or running torpedoes, all the endless jobs destroyers are called to do when in company with a big fleet. Some of these jobs lasted a few hours, some the best part of a week. Admirals who wanted three destroyers were an absolute nightmare; it meant the odd man left behind would almost certainly have to go on some other job before his proper mates got back, it might be weeks before they met again and could be re-sorted. The fleet put to sea and the destroyers on the spot had to be hastily organized and joined up into divisions almost anyhow; a most demoralizing business and one that in my humble opinion reduced the fighting value of the destroyers by not less than fifty per cent. I do now believe the chief reason for the unhappy condition of the flotillas was that at the very outbreak of war the then head of them, Commodore Tyrwhitt, was taken away for a subsidiary command at Harwich. True enough extremely important work and every one knows how well it was performed. All the same, had he remained with the fleet and led the destroyers at Jutland, the services he might have rendered that day and night would have been overwhelmingly more important than even the Harwich force, and these remarks are not to be read in any criticism of Commodore Hawkesley who was actually in charge at Jutland. I do not think Hawkesley ever had a chance; the disorganization had come long before he had ever been appointed as commodore. In fact the battle was fought before he had even been relieved from the command of the flotilla he was in. I found too that months passed without ships getting a chance owing to pressure of other work, of doing either gunnery or torpedo practices. Torpedoes were still parted on deck immediately after running, with the result that too often they never ran again, because there was never time to do the job properly. In future it was decreed that torpedoes after running were to be returned to Port Edgar and others drawn in lieu.

The system which had been in force before the War, I found still in use, that is, when we went out for a gunnery practice, we did gunnery when it was a torpedo practice, we did torpedo, if it was merely a tactical exercise, the first lieutenant or sub helped the captain on the bridge. It seemed to be forgotten that in action all these things happened simultaneously, or probably would, and that training must be organized accordingly. In future, when we fired guns we also fired at least one torpedo at the same target and at the same time.

I had in mind one or two axioms for daylight work with destroyers. First that a single destroyer was a weak weapon. A number of destroyers, the maximum that could be properly handled, was a very strong one. Destroyers should never, if possible, be allowed to engage surface craft at less strength than a division (four).

That for torpedo fighting “time of flight” is the key problem. That any single torpedo has little chance of hitting an alert target; that only by increasing the number of torpedoes in the water at once, is it possible to frustrate “avoiding action”. In order to get realistic practice at speed, throw-off firing was introduced. This was a common practice in big ships but had not hitherto been considered suitable for destroyers.

After a few days divisional and half-flotilla firing I took the whole flotilla out for combined gunnery and torpedo practice. I was the target in the *Champion*, the guns being thrown-off, the torpedoes run at me. I admit I was scared; the guns of between twenty and thirty destroyers, mounting five guns each, give a surprising volume of fire. Moreover, if the line gets stretched out, shots from the rear ships come at an unpleasantly acute angle.

I do believe, however, the first combined exercise of the sort, primitive as it was — for we had not even started divisional or flotilla control — did make many realize what a powerful weapon a flotilla was.

It was very difficult to find time and opportunity to get exercises done. There was complete disorganization when everything having been arranged, the squadron put to sea, which happened pretty often, generally round the Dogger Bank or up to the Skager rack, these sudden moves, the result of some secret information that the enemy were out, seldom resulted in anything beyond hard steaming usually, it seemed, in bad weather, a return to base in the early hours of the next morning, oil, and resume the broken programme of exercises. Only once, in November 1917, did we surprise the enemy; and he also surprised us unfortunately. I was in my usual station, five miles ahead of the *Lion*, with the destroyers in anti-submarine formation on my port and starboard quarters screening the battle-cruisers. The *Courageous*, then a cruiser, not yet converted into an aircraft carrier, had been sent ahead with a division of destroyers. A calm morning with a light fog or mist. I had just made out the *Courageous* when she opened fire at an unseen enemy and turned to the north. Simultaneously shells began pitching between the *Courageous* and my own ship. These shells were definitely coming from the south, so that I could not understand the turn to the north. *Courageous* may have sighted something invisible to us, there was no doubt of an enemy to the south although we could see nothing. We increased to full speed and steered south in the direction from which the shells seemed to be coming; almost immediately we ran into an artificial smoke screen through which we made out an enemy minesweeper stopped. I detached a destroyer to take off the crew and sink the ship, while I stood on with the remainder. The enemy fog screen was most efficient and it was impossible to even make a guess at what was going on. I thought I made out the *Onslow*, one of the destroyers detached, steaming at high speed, firing her bow guns evidently chasing something, but the fog shut down again at once, and we saw no more. Shortly after we received a wireless message from the *Lion* to return and take up screening stations, there had been a submarine scare as so often happened and the squadron had turned away to the north. As we emerged from the smoke we got a view of *Repulse* going all out, steering south, and it seemed to us cutting right across the minefield. We still heard heavy firing at intervals. It appeared the High Seas Fleet did commence to come out, and had in fact fired a few shots, one of which found the bridge of the *Calypso* and killed the captain, H. L. Edwards, one of my term in the *Britannia*. All day we steamed up and down; the First Battle Squadron came up in support, but nothing happened; they had gone back to port. To clarify the situation to other than naval readers it might be as well to explain here, that this contact with the enemy took place at the end of the swept channel leading into the Heligoland Bight, and would have been in clear weather almost in range of the guns of Heligoland.

I confess, when the following day on board the *Queen Elizabeth*, I gathered the C.-in-C. was anything but pleased, and I heard him say that the whole lot ought to have been mopped up, it only then dawned on me that the operation had been planned from information received that minesweepers were at work each night at the entrance of the channel, returning to harbour each morning. We had been sent to cut them off; not one word of this had been imparted to me. The destroyers were accustomed to steam with the battle-cruisers round the Dogger Bank at frequent and irregular intervals, generally north. About this time we went south but as far as we knew there was nothing special in view, we were ready at sea for anything but it so happened as we came out of the smoke screen that day my rear destroyers sighted and reported two more minesweepers. I could easily have detached two more ships had I known the object, as it was I had been recalled and naturally expected more important work in view. It seemed that although a minor operation, the lack of information was still to be the cause of partial failure, as it had been on the far more important issue of the Battle of Jutland, I never knew — nor do I now, why the *Courageous* turned north that morning, or why the *Calypso* and her party stood south followed apparently by the *Repulse*. I did know, however, that Sir David was very upset, and it was no time to say some one, presumably the staff in the *Lion*, had slipped up and we had no idea what was wanted from us.
