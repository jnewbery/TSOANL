## CHAPTER 1

## THE STORY OF A NAVAL LIFE 

Some few years ago there appeared an article in *The Times* headed "The Extinct Tweedie Family". The family are not extinct; in almost every Dominion of the Empire I have met or heard of families bearing the name and tracing descent from the same family who for so many generations dwelt on the banks of the Tweed. The first authentic mention of the family dates 1115, but legend goes back much further and legend gives the story of the Spirit of the Tweed, becoming enamoured of a fair lady walking by Tweed Pool. A son was born and appears first as John of the Tweed, then Tueda and so Tweedie.

The name appears constantly in all Border history - in 1351 we find Tweedie of Drummelzier married the fourth daughter of Sir James Douglas and Lady Agnes Douglas. This Lady Agnes was the celebrated Black Agnes of whom Sir Walter Scott writes: 

> *She kept a stir in tower and trench*  
> *That brawling, boisterous Scottish wench.*

From 1388 there is a gap of nearly a generation in the family records, it was the year of Otterbourne that famous and historic fight between the Douglasses and the Tweedies on the one side, and the Percys on the other, following a raid by the Scots into Northumbria. A recent discovery has disclosed over a thousand skulls all lying together near the scene of the encounter and this no doubt accounted for most of the family of an age to bear arms.

The next hundred years and more are full of records of family feuds of the deadliest sort and we read that on 18th November 1458 Sir William Cockburn and his two brothers slew Roger Tweedie and Walter his brother in the streets of Edinburgh, for which the Cockburns were ordered to “satisfy” the Tweedies with whom, and the Veitchs, they had at this time a “deidly feid”; one cannot help liking the word “satisfy” used in this record and wonder what form the satisfaction took. But feuds with all the surrounding families appeared to be constant and the family of Nasmith comes much into the picture; it seems a Nasmith last slew a Tweedie and was ordered by the Provost of Peebles to pay three hundred sheep, presumably by way of recompense There is no record of these sheep having been delivered, so finding myself occupying the next room at the Admiralty to Captain Nasmith, I asked him for my sheep or as I was not particularly interested now in mutton I offered to accept payment in almost anything, but nothing came of it.

In spite of the feuds and constant “cruel slauchteris” the Tweedies owned much land and in 1536 James Tweedie of Drummelzier married “Marjorie”, sister of the Queen of Scotland, and King James V invited himself to the marriage, Tweedie being described as “the Laird of Drummelzier, chief of the Tweedies, as imminent a baron, and as of great command as any in Tweeddale”. The lands of Rachan, Oliver, Quarter, Drummelzier, Dreva and other properties all remained in the family until well into my own lifetime, when like so many other families who lived on the land, and by the land they had to give way to others enjoying more lucrative ways of making a livelihood.

Nothing remains now to the Tweedies except the ruins of the old castles, still to be seen, and the ancient family motto “Thole and think on”.

My grandfather was the son of Tweedie of Rachan and served during the Peninsular Wars in the Royal Artillery, afterwards living for many years at Rolvenden in Kent, and how he came to get to Kent from Scotland seems worth recalling.

A certain Mr. Forbes of Watertown in Aberdeenshire having a delicate wife came south to escape the rigours of a Scottish climate and bought the estate of Rawlinson in the parish of Rolvenden.

My grandfather returning after the Battle of Waterloo was landed with his battery at the then Port of Rye to march to Woolwich; on the way he fell sick and was left at the village inn. Mr. Forbes hearing there was an officer left behind in the inn, had him brought up to the house for better comfort and nursing. The upshot of the matter was, that the young officer recovering, in due course, married the only daughter of the house, thus uniting two Scottish families by a chance meeting in Kent.

My father followed in his father's footsteps and saw much service in the Crimea, Indian Mutiny, and the Red River Campaign in Canada.

It always seems interesting to me to remember that my own father with his battery marched from Alexandria to Suez *en route* to India because the Suez Canal was not then in existence. Eventually like all gunners he came to Woolwich, met my mother at a Woolwich ball, and at Woolwich I was eventually born.

In 1879 my father was sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and we made the voyage in the *Scotia*, a square-rigged paddle-
