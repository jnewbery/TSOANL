The next hundred years and more are full of records of family feuds of the deadliest sort and we read that on 18th November 14 ;s Sir William Cockburn and his two brothers slew Roger Tweedie and Walter his brother in the streets of Edinburgh, for which the Cockburns were ordered to “satisfy” the Tweedies with whom, and the Veitchs, they had at this time a “deidly feid”; one cannot help liking the word “satisfy” used in this record and wonder what form the satisfaction took.
